token-kxs:
  title: Token $KXS
  metaTitle: Kryxivia • The Kryxivia Coin $KXS
  h1: Kryxivia $KXS Coin
  intro: >-
    The KXS coin, or Kryxivia Shard Coin, is the in-game currency used in the
    world of Kryxivia. It can be used to buy, trade, and acquire new in-game
    items. As with any cryptocurrency, the KXS carries certain risks and
    economic fluctuations. Therefore, it has a large supply available to ensure
    that every player has the opportunity to participate in the dynamic economy
    of Kryxivia
  txt1: >-
    The KXS token, or Kryxivia Shard Coin, has a maximum supply of 5,000,000,000
    KXS (5B), making it more widely available and useful in the game compared to
    the KXA token. The KXS token is mintable, meaning that new ones can be
    created for in-game rewards or special events. It can be traded on CEX and
    DEX like any other currency.
  txt2: >-
    The KXS token is also deflationary, as it can be used in-game for special
    rewards. For example, if you want to link your items to Kryxit gems, you
    will need to burn some KXS to do so. Additionally, if you want to purchase
    consumable items like potions to aid you on your journey, you will need to
    burn KXS tokens to buy them from city NPCs.
  txt3: >-
    The in-game token will have base liquidity on a decentralized protocol
    backed by the KXA token in a managed pool to ensure the buying and selling
    ability of the in-game token. However, the primary way to obtain KXS tokens
    will still be through in-game play and winning rewards, as our system is
    designed to be "play to earn."
token-kxa:
  title: Token $KXA
  metaTitle: Kryxivia • The Kryxivia Coin $KXA
  h1: Kryxivia $KXA Coin
  intro: >-
    The KXA token, built on the Ethereum blockchain, is the primary
    cryptocurrency used in Kryxivia. It can be used for on-chain payments and
    special bundles, as well as to purchase cosmetics and participate in special
    NFT sales events. The KXA can also be exchanged for the in-game currency,
    KXS, or used to buy and sell items on the NFT marketplace.
  txt1: >-
    Kryxivia coin has a fixed maximum supply of 250,000,000 KXA coins. Our
    tokenomics are designed to be specific and consistent. The KXA token is not
    mintable, meaning that no more than 250M KXAs can be issued.
  txt2: >-
    We use the ERC20 standard to minimize on-chain transaction fees. You can
    also use KXA coin to purchase and sell NFT properties, such as items,
    Kryxit, and spells, on our online marketplace using your wallet (such as
    Metamask).

      In the world of Kryxivia, NFTs play a central role in determining your
      character's level. Your character's level is based on the items you have
      equipped, traded on the marketplace, or obtained from defeating monsters
      in the Kryxivia mine. These items have an iLvl, or item level, attached to
      them, and defeating bosses will reward you with equipment, Kryxit Shard
      coin (KXS), and spells. The value of these loot items is determined by
      algorithmic calculations based on player activity, ensuring a sustainable
      economy. Some NFTs may be super-limited, meaning they may never be
      obtained again once a certain number has been dropped, or they may have
      daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly limits. Join the adventure and see what
      NFTs you can collect!

      In a world before the dawn of industry, a mysterious door was discovered
      in the mountains. Those who ventured through it discovered the magical
      gems known as Kryxit, imbued with immense power. These discoveries drew
      people from across the land to Kryxivia, a burgeoning city built
      haphazardly by small groups of adventurers and merchants.
    txt2: >-
      The people of Kryxivia come from all walks of life and often have
      mismatched outfits, pieced together from their travels. As metal gear is
      scarce and expensive, many resort to wearing a combination of cloth,
      leather, and metal.
    txt3: >-
      The city sprang up around the door and merchants flocked to this busy hub
      to profit from the influx of people seeking their fortune. Now, years
      later, most who come to Kryxivia are mercenaries or independents like
      yourself, seeking loot and adventure beyond the door.
    txt4: >-
      Men will bring a lot of loot from the door but they will not always come
      back. The city of Kryxivia began to form around the door and many
      merchants took profit from this highly frequented place. Now, a few years
      later most of the people who try their luck are mercenaries or
      independents, like you.
